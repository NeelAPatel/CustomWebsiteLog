# Me-CustomWebsite
This repository stores my attempts at making a website using HTML/CSS after learning it from Codeacademy. Eventually I hope to learn Javascript as well for more flexibility. Almost 100% of the content will be hard-coded, as it is my preffered method of learning. 

## Site 1
Idea: Tabs/Buttons on the right, Content on the left. Clicking a tab would shrink it to its title and update the content area on the left.
Cards theme for Tabs was drawn from Google's open source Material Design Language.

## Site 2
Idea: Static vertical header with Name and social media icons below. Beside it would be a sidebar for different sections of the website. In the future I hope to use some scrolling magic to make it flow nicely.
